## Research Experience

### Security Analysis of Multimodal Semantic Alignment
**Tsinghua University** | Advisor : Prof. Yinpeng Dong
*June 2025 – Present*
*   Leveraged interpretability methods to investigate the safety mechanisms of Visual Language Models (VLMs), focusing on safety aspects identified in recent academic literature.
*   Investigated the transfer of existing Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to multimodal learning, focusing on reconciling the disparity between continuous image semantics and discrete text semantics.

### Multi-Image Multimodal Knowledge Editing
**King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)** | Advisor : Prof. Di wang
*May 2025 – Present*
*   Currently drafting a research paper that identifies limitations of existing single-image knowledge editing methods and, for the first time, formally defines the novel research task of "Multi-Image Knowledge Editing," with a focus on ensuring complex multi-image editing for Visual Language Models (VLMs).
*   Led the design and construction of the first benchmark dataset for this task, spanning multiple domains including landmarks, products, and characters.

### Test-Time Out-of-Distribution Detection
**The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HK PolyU)** | Advisor : Rundong He
*January 2025 – May 2025*
*   Introduced a discriminative score and importance-driven typical set rectification method. By estimating the discrimination score of each channel, enhanced Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection performance through feature set rectification.
*   Proposed a skewness-based rectification approach to rectify the actual channel distribution, making it more Gaussian-like and improving detection robustness.
*   Conducted extensive experimental evaluations on the ImageNet-1K and CIFAR benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches and strong generalization across architectures and OOD scoring methods.

### Multimodal Time Series Forecasting
**Shandong University** | Advisor : Prof. Yongshun Gong
*September 2024 – May 2025*
*   Designed an LLM-driven News Disentangler to decompose news into meta-environmental factors and sudden events, modeling their distinct causal impacts on time series forecasting.
*   Developed a backdoor adjustment mechanism with learnable vector quantization to mitigate confounding bias from meta-environmental factors, enhancing model interpretability.
*   Introduced a novel Counterfactual Reflection Agent combining counterfactual reasoning and self-reflection to filter spurious correlations in sudden events, improving forecasting robustness.

### OOD Learning on Graph
**Shandong University** | Advisor : Prof. Yongshun Gong
*September 2024 – January 2025*
*   Conducted in-depth analysis of existing OOD methods, identifying limitations in specific scenarios and proposing targeted improvements to enhance model robustness.
*   Introduced a lightweight module approach to the implementation of OOD generalization methods, achieving comparable performance while significantly reducing training time.
*   Explored new OOD scenarios and datasets, expanding the application scope of existing methods and identifying areas for further improvement.
